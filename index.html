      <p><em>[Intro]</em></p>
      <p>Baby, yeah</p>
      <p>Baby, baby</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
    <p><em>[Verse]</em></p>
    <p>Nineteen (Baby!)</p>
    <p>Inverted baby</p>
    <p>Bright blue sky scenes, obscura in my bedroom</p>
    <p>Lying on the floor, we had some times</p>
    <p>Bad ideas</p>
    <p>Soft spoken music to my ears (Yeah)</p>
    <p>I wish I had spent the time (I'm not quite sure what went wrong)</p>

    <figure>
      <p><em>[Pre-Chorus]</em></p>
      <p>But no, our legacy sheets can bring me sweet dreams</p>
      <p>How strang is it when ours is lost in them (Baby)</p>
      <p>I said whenever you called, I'd be there (Baby)</p>
      <p>I hope you never take advice from your friends (Never, never)</p>
      <p>Crammed into the back seat of my first car that I drove too fast, running from the thought I</p>
      <p>Know you don't get it when I say I been ballin'</p>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <p><em>[Chorus]</em></p>
      <p>It's all bless</p>
      <p>You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all (O-oh)</p>
      <p>How can I dance myself clean?</p>
      <p>These rooms just dirty my soles (Easy)</p>
      <p>Slowly my friends turned to places</p>
      <p>I can't be everywhere at once</p>
      <p>I watched some friends turn to places</p>
      <p>Now it's just a one-way convo (Yeah)</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p><em>[Bridge]</em></p>
      <p>And til' you're not afraid of goin'</p>
      <p>I'll be right here on your arm</p>
      <p>And when it's not my choice in stayin'</p>
      <p>I'll go</p>

      <p>We were just kids</p>
      <p>You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all (O-oh)</p>
      <p>How can I dance myself clean?</p>
      <p>These rooms just dirty my soles</p>
      <p>Slowly my friends turned to places (I watched friends turn to places)</p>
      <p>And I can't be everywher at once (And I can't go and visit them all)</p>
